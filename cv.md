Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and everything in its orbit. I recently began to be fascinated by web programming, e.g. developing apps and building websites. As this area complements my studies, I am keen to gain more experience in the field. For this reason, I am looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among their developers. In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and friendly addition to your team. I am therefore currently looking for a job or an internship as a front-end developer.

**Skills:**
JavaScript / Python / HTML / CSS / Sass / BEM / Bootstrap4 / MySQL / GIT, GitHub

**Code examples:**
* [projects on GitHub](https://github.com/lenazamnius)
* [progress on  codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/users/lena.zamnius) 

**Experience:** I have no experience in the field of IT. But I am self-learning on various online platforms and constantly applying, what I have learned, into  various small independent projects to improve my skills as a programmer.
