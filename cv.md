Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and everything in its orbit. I recently began to be fascinated by web programming, e.g. developing apps and building websites. As this area complements my studies, I am keen to gain more experience in the field. For this reason, I am looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among their developers. In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and friendly addition to your team. I am therefore currently looking for a job or an internship as a front-end developer.
